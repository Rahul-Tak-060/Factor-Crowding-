## ✅ Checklist: "Have I Read Enough?"

Before coding, you should be able to answer:
- [ ] What are the four factors being analyzed?
- [ ] What does "crowding" mean in this context?
- [ ] What is the main research finding? (crowding predicts crashes)
- [ ] Where is the crowding index calculated? (features/crowding.py)
- [ ] Where is crash detection done? (analysis/drawdowns.py)
- [ ] What is the AUC score? (0.88)
- [ ] How do I run the full analysis? (factor-crowding run)

If yes to all → You're ready to use/modify the code! 🎉

If no → Read the documents matched to your "no" answers.
